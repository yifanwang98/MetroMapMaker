# MetroMapMaker
  
* This is my Fall 2017 CSE219 final project;  
* Metro Map Maker is a traditional workspace-type application completed using Java and JavaFX;  
* The Metro Map Maker hopes to be a site where one can go to make and exchange real world subway maps for metro systems in cities around the world and then plot routes through these systems. Why use a site like this? Well, because one may be interested in making their own map of a given metro system that looks completely different from existing standard maps. The site itself is under construction and it will provide the service of letting one choose an existing map created by a user and so let the entire community view the map and plot routes. What the site is being created the hope is to develop a desktop Java application that can be used for creating the maps to be used by the site. Maps means map images with corresponding JSON files describing the map contents;
* It let the user make subway maps complete with all station and metro line data such that they can be drawn in great detail and routes can be plotted;  
* It allows user to add graphic representation of landmarks, and choose desired background style;  
* It allows user to find the shortest route between two stations, using breadth-first search;  
* Details of this project is specified in file "MetroMapMakerSRS.pdf", which is the software requirements specification for this project.
