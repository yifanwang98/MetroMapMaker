# MetroMapMaker
* Metro Map Maker is a traditional workspace-type application completed using Java and JavaFX;  
* It let the user make subway maps complete with all station and metro line data such that they can be drawn in great detail and routes can be plotted;  
* It allows user to add graphic representation of landmarks, and choose desired background style;  
* It allows user to find the shortest route between two stations, using breadth-first search;  
* This is my Fall 2017 CSE 219 final project.
